# Privacy Policy — Bible Verse SMS

**Last updated:** 2025-02-17

This privacy policy describes how the Bible Verse SMS service (“we,” “the service”) collects, uses, and protects information when you send a text message to our number.

---

## What data we collect

When you text our number, we receive and process only:

- **Your phone number** (the number from which you sent the message)
- **The content of your message** (the exact text you send, e.g. a Bible reference or partial verse)

We do not collect your name, email address, or any other personal information unless you include it in the message text.

---

## How we use this data

We use this information solely to:

1. **Fulfill your request** — to look up the Bible verse or passage you asked for and send you the reply.
2. **Operate the service** — our systems (including third-party providers we use to deliver the service) process your phone number and message so we can respond with the requested verse.

Your phone number is used only to send the reply back to you. Your message content is used only to determine which verse to look up and is not used for profiling, advertising, or any purpose other than answering your request.

## Third parties and marketing

- **We do not sell, rent, or share your phone number or message content with third parties for marketing or advertising.**
- **We do not use your data for marketing.** We do not send you promotional messages or use your information to target you with ads.

To provide the service we use:

- **Twilio** — to receive your SMS and send our reply. Twilio processes your phone number and message content only as necessary to deliver the messages. Twilio’s own privacy policy applies to their handling of that data.
- **Google (Gemini)** — we may send the text of your message to Google’s Gemini API to interpret references or partial quotes. This is used only to identify the verse you want; we do not use it for advertising or other purposes.
- **API.Bible** — we use it only to retrieve the verse text we send you. We do not send your phone number to API.Bible.

These providers are used only to operate the Bible verse lookup and reply. We do not allow them to use your data for their own marketing or to share it for marketing purposes.

## Data retention and security

- We do not store your messages or phone number for longer than needed to process your request and send the reply, unless we are required to keep limited logs for security or legal reasons.
- We take reasonable steps to protect the data we process (including use of secure connections and access controls where applicable).

---

## Your choices

You can stop using the service at any time by simply not texting our number. We do not maintain a separate marketing list; the only messages you receive are replies to the texts you send.

---

## Changes to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect the latest version. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
