By texting the Bible Verse SMS number, you agree to these terms and conditions.

## Program name

**Bible Verse SMS**

---

## Description

Bible Verse SMS is a text-message service that returns Bible verses on request. You send a message with a Bible reference (e.g. “John 3:16”) or a partial quote; the service looks up the verse and replies with the text in your chosen translation (default KJV; ESV, NIV, NASB, and NLT available). You may also request “with context” to receive surrounding verses.

## Message and data rates

**Message and data rates may apply** depending on your wireless plan. Standard SMS rates from your carrier apply to each message you send and each reply you receive. The service does not charge a separate fee; check with your carrier for details.

---

## Message frequency

You receive messages only when you text the service. Each reply is sent in response to a single message from you. There is no recurring or subscription messaging; message frequency is determined entirely by how often you choose to text.

---

## Support contact

For help, questions, or to report issues:

- **Repository:** Open an issue at the GitHub repository for this project.
- **Contact:** Use the contact or repository-owner information provided where this service is advertised or documented.

---

## Opt-out instructions

You can stop receiving messages at any time.

- **STOP** — Text **STOP** to the Bible Verse SMS number to opt out. You will receive one final confirmation message. After that, you will not receive further replies. You can opt back in by texting the number again with a new verse request.
- **HELP** — Text **HELP** to the Bible Verse SMS number for a short message with usage instructions and support contact information.

(If the service does not yet respond to STOP or HELP, you may simply stop texting the number; no further messages will be sent unless you text again.)

---

## Acceptable use

Use the service only for personal, non-commercial Bible verse lookup. Do not use it to send spam, abuse the system, or violate any applicable laws or carrier terms.

---

## Changes

We may update these terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date above will change when we do. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
